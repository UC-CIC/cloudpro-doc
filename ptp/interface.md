# Modular Questionnaire/Scoring Interface System
There may be a need to allow for integration with API's that are external to CloudPRO's core code. An example of this could be the PROMIS Assessment API (https://staging.healthmeasures.net/implement-healthmeasures/administration-platforms/assessment-center-api); these API's can facilitate the retrieval of questions as well as scoring in an external fashion. Configuration & workflow towards external API platforms should be developed in a modular fashion.

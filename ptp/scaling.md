# Scaling & Replicability

The CloudPRO Prototype focused on the Thoracic speciality and PROMIS based studies as it's target audience; however, the nature of CloudPRO provides the opportunity for larger scale.

**Opportunities for Scale:**

* The architecture lends itself to being able to scale out to multiple departments utilizing the same platform
* The core functionality can be replicated across multiple medical specialities and is not limitted to just Thoracic use.
* There is opportunity to scale across industry; the concept of questionnaires & scoring is not unique to the medical field, and the modular concept of PROPacks & PROPack Scoring can allow adapation to other industries.
* Functionality of PROPacks can be extended to support additional use cases beyond just text based questions.

# PROPack HL7 FHIR Support

The CloudPRO prototype supports only a custom format for definition of studies and scoring. As the target of this product would be within the medical community, an MVP should ideally release with support for HL7 FHIR. This open format is supported by many EMR systems and is a leading open source standard for interoperability. Utilizing this format, questionnaires as well as scoring algorithms could be defined.

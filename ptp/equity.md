# Equity Considerations

Increasing equity and patient access is one of the ultimate goals of the CloudPRO platform.

There are some key areas to consider to help increase equity:

- Increase supported languages from English & Spanish to several others
- Expand Access Channels
    - The initial design plans for CloudPRO do not take into consideration patients that may not have access to the internet or a smartphone. To expand access, the CloudPRO system should allow for surveys to be taken through an interactive phone call. This approach raises a few questions that will need to be solved.
        - How will the user be authenticated?
        - How will opt-in/opt-out be managed?
        - What technology will be utilized for the IVR system?
        - How will this work from a workflow perspective at clinics?
    - Consider patients that do not want to partake in a digital method of PRO's and prefer paper surveys. The system should provide an avenue for identifying the patient and storing their survey results.
- ADA compliance will be crucial on the platform.
- Consider how end users can be supported if they have issues within the system.

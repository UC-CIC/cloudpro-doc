# Vision

The CloudPRO prototype aims to provide the foundations for an open-source product that can be utilized by customers to accelerate development and lower risk for a production implementation.

It is important to note that there is a clear distinction between prototype and MVP. A prototype focuses on providing an early product sample to demonstrate parts of an idea before it is fully developed â€“ it should not be considered a complete product; an MVP however, is the first version of the product containing core features and released to an audience.

The three tenants of a prototype are as follows:
* A prototype will contain only features that are sufficient for development environments and will require further software enhancement to move from prototype to MVP
* A prototype will allow for fail fast/fail early to test/validate ideas and pivot if needed
* A prototype will focus on features that are most important to validate

CloudPRO envisions a software ecosystem that allows for the open source community to develop & enhance core product functionality, as well as collaborate on development of PROPacks to support various studies. Although medical departments have the flexibility to deploy and manage the software through their own IT resources, CloudPRO is well suited to be deployed in a SaaS based structure.

The "Pathway to Production" documentation aims to explore areas that would be necessary for a production implementation of this prototype as well as dive into some of the gaps and areas that the CloudPRO prototype did not explore.

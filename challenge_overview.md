# Challenge Overview

## Problem Background

Medical departments often use disparate software platforms or manual processes to manage PRO
data collection. This leaves surgeons with numerous blind spots and biases in understanding how
their patients’ recovery is progressing leading to patient education with incomplete data. This gap is
exacerbated by the fact that of the data successfully collected regarding patients’ post-operative
journey, underserved patients typically underreport. These factors create uncertainty and anxiety for
the surgeon, impacting quality of patients’ experience.

## Proposed Solution

The CloudPRO platform, a cloud-based environment to support survey distribution, survey response
collection, and use of electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) scoring for any medical specialty in
the world. ePROs are used by surgeons to both monitor patients’ post-surgical process and provide
evidence of population-level recovery patterns. This platform provides a centralized mechanism for
patients to report their experience and surgeons to view patients’ survey scoring history.

Patients can enroll themselves, or be enrolled by a trusted third party, allowing them to complete
surveys which typically take only 2 minutes. These responses are interpreted by CloudPRO and
made available to surgeons allowing them to be able to track the progress of their patients.

CloudPRO will differentiate itself from readily available platforms through the following:
* Encourage mass adoption within a medical specialty of a singular
platform built from the ground up
* Embrace a collaborative open source approach to the platform instead of a proprietary &
closed ecosystem
* Provide technical foundations for an open framework of PRO delivery & scoring that can be
adopted at scale across systems.
* Low barrier of entry cost point
* Modularity and extensibility
